-met in iesb to discuss overall project framework
-after reasoning with our strengths and weaknesses and tasks to be done:
    -Steph:  *in charge of designing GPIO function interface framework
             *draw prgram GPIO flowchart
    -Joseph: *research tkinter GUI and other GUI modules.
             *make working GUI draft
    -August: *make circuit digram of all parts and wires in software
             *make order sheet of parts
    -all     *get familiar with git

5.6.2024
-met and discussed in class how our overall project is coming together and the overall picture:
    -by this time, joseph has a fully working final GUI. what must be thought of is the tethering of data 
        passed through from the main file to the GUI.
    -Me and Steph discussed the overall outline of main and brainstormed/psuedocoded how a few important 
        parts of the programwould gather and return data. They were the "sensor read" function, and 
        the main GUI loop
-later this evening, me and stephanie have:
    -make a rough draft of our presentation fold-up board
    -helped fix Stephanie's git setup (without breaking anything yay)
    -started to type out pseudocode for respective functions
        -implemented real code
    -created a "main.py" to organize everything
    -ran tests on the raspberry pi, and debugged potential GPIO sensor issues
*in this process I have pulled all branches into mine, and will combine all changes with no conflictions and
    push to main

5.8.2024
-me and Stephaie met in the evening and worked for for hours finalizing the Sensor.py file and how Main.py 
    connects everything. (utilizes classes and modifies GUI)
-we also translated everything to Le Potato and debugged the operation of the code and the Sensors
-Stephanie additionally drafted the presenattion tri-fold board to be completed 5.9.2024
