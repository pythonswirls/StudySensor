    First official meeting 
        -tried to set up git unsucessfully
        -split up the project where Joseph starts on the GUI, August starts with the circuit and parts list
         and I start with the GPIO code for the two ultrasonic sensors

4-15-2024
    Started working on the outline for the main code. Doesn't seem like we would need a lot of functions

4-22-2024
    Since we are using two different sensors with the same functionality with little difference, made a Sensor 
    class with the name and pins being the difference. Didn't do much else, too busy.

4-29-2024
    Mapped out the functionality and what outputs we would need from our functions and re wrote most of the outline
    with August. Thought about using two differnet time modules. Mapped out the code that would need to be integrated 
    with Joseph at a weekly meeting. 

5-6-2024
    Finally made some progress on the rest of the code functions and ran the first mock test. Doesn't work yet but runs the 
    code without any major errors. Also pushed most of the work to github, this time without deleting the whole repo.
