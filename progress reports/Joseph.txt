4/4/24:
Met for the first time, split work into three main sections to be completed seperately.
Stephanie -> GPIO portions of the code.
Joseph -> GUI portion of the code.
August -> Hardware portion of the code.

GPIO will include getting information from the sensors and transmitting it to the GUI.

GUI will include a menu interface, possibly a real-time map (depending on difficulty), 
and any other major functions.

Hardware will consist of two sensors conected to a rasberry pi (or substitute).

4/7/2024:
Created first iteration of GUI. Tkinter is very annoying, but without better alternatives, I will manage as is.

4/12/2024:
Worked on it between classes during the past week, first menu is done. Reminder to research tkinter 
alternatives and to play around with the colors. Currently looks too unnatural.

4/20/2024:
Too busy to get much work done. Got some alternative choices though. Pygame might be the simplest 
and I already have some experience with it. I'll consider it after my math test.

4/24/2024:
Swapped to pygame because Tkinter is still annoying to work with. Redid the frontal menu and made a 
help menu. Still need to add more buttons and play around with theme. Also did questionably on that math test.

4/27~28/2024:
Remembered to commit my changes today. Also added a building menu to skip the map segment if intended. 
Translated the code to a class. Took a while to ensure a back button existed, but it works now.
Gonna work on filling out the help menu and room creation later tonight.

4/30/2024:
Met up with the group, worked on github shennigans for almost two hours. Filled out the help menu and got some
of the work done on the room creation. Still need to make rooms with stats from GPIO file, and set up map.

5/3/2024:
Finished up the rooms, just need the information from the sensor to adjust the values. Map is still being troublesome.
May need to add that to the QOL section.

5/6/2024:
Finished up map and labeling. Worked on integration with GPIO setup with group. Should be effectively done for presentation.

5/8/2024 ~ 5/9/2024:
Redid run() function to work without mainloop. Integrated with GPIO to work properly.
