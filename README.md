# StudySensor
### CSC 132 Final Pi Project
### Louisiana Tech University

For our design project, we needed to come up with a producted that used the Le Potato, it's GPIO output/input, and an Intuitive GUI. We decided to go with a "StudySensor", which utilizes two HR-SC04 Sonic Sensors to detect someone entering a study room. The information is passed from the sensor setup, managed by two instantiations of a single python class, to the "Main" portion of the program, then to the "GUI" portion.
The entirety of the program is written in python, and uses modules Pygame, Pygame-menu, time, and more.
